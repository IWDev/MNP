Multi-Node Processing Framework (MNP)
===

MNP is a framework for developers that allows a task to be executed seperately from the target application. 

The framework is designed to be extensible allowing for plugins to be written for almost any component of the system. This allows developers to leviate existing solutions such as distributed message queues and caching.

**Note:** *This project is very much a work in progress so it is not recommended to be used in a production environment. Packages will be released to Nuget once the framework is stable*
